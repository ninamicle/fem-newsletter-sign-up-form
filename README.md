## My process

### Built with

- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

My goal for this project was to learn the basics of Vue.js. 
I learned about attribute binding, how components communicate, how to emit events, and how to work with a simple form. 
I even tried using dynamic components, but I encountered some issues when passing dynamic props to the active component. 
I will continue to learn and resolve these problems.
